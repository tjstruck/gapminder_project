This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r final-exercise}
library('dplyr')
three_countries = c('Togo','Taiwan','Sweden')
gap <- read.table('output/combined_gapMinder.tsv', sep = '\t',  header = TRUE)

togo <- subset(gap, country == 'Togo')
plot(togo[,2],togo[,6])

taiwan <- subset(gap, country == 'Taiwan')
plot(taiwan[,2],taiwan[,6])

sweden <- subset(gap, country == 'Sweden')
plot(sweden[,2],sweden[,6])

```

```{r read-in-data}
gap <- read.table('output/combined_gapMinder.tsv', sep = '\t',  header = TRUE)
gap %>%
  select(year,pop,country,continent) %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(pop))


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
